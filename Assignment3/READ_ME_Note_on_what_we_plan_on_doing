Adding starter files,
*** note for team ***
-->We plan on using the test 2 approach
	So the r2 folder from the Prof. python test framework
	is not required.

--> Will write all the transactions into one file[initial named as test_main_approach2],
	make it simple to read. 
--> Finally,submit the program with only the required files in a new folder
